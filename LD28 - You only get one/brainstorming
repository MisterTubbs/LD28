LD28 12/13/13 - You only get one

-you only get one ring, and you have to defeat a horde of zombies to win
-you only have one companion (probably animal EX dog) and you two have to fight hordes of enemies. Maybe the companion has one special power that can only be used once per round? - probably what I'm going with
-One click chain reaction game, could be fun but way more technical and overdone
-you only get one chance to make it through a level
-combo of both (maze and animal thing && maybe one click chain reaction?)

I NEED TO START WORKING!
